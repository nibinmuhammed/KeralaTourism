                    <h1>Alappuzha</h1>
                    <p>Kerala is referred as the ‘God’s Own Country’ for its utter natural beauty. Alappuzha or Alleppey as it is more popular has its own scenic beauty contributed by the numerous water bodies, rivers, backwater and sea which essentially made Alappuzha, undoubtedly, one of the major tourist destination in Kerala.

                        ‘The Venice of the East’ is also one of the busiest port town on the western coastline. The main attraction of Alappuzha is the backwater tourism popularized by the beautiful traditional house boats floating on the serene water. This place is a perfect gateway for the tourists to embrace the nature.
                        
                        Another definitive feature of Alappuzha tourism is the classic dance form of Kathakali, an unequaled concoction of dance, drama, story-telling and painting all with the elaborate make-up and animated movements. Alappuzha is also the hub of Coir manufacturing which is made of the coconut husk. Visitors are drawn to catch up the manufacturing process in many factories. There are several other attractive spots in Alappuzha which draw thousands of tourists throughout the year in this place.</p>
